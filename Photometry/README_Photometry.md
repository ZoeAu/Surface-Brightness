###Current goals / issues:

1. The script carrys out photometry using coordinates in units of both degress and pixels. This should be simplified to a single unit system.

2. The running of photometry and calculation of values uses multiple loops. I would like to simplify the script so that less loops are used and running is hopefully decreased.

3. If the photometric value is given as zero the supernova may or may not be within the fit's files field of view

4. I need to check error propgation
