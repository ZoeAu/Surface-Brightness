# Calculating UV Surface Brightness of 1kpc Radius Regions around Supernova

#### Code Overview / use:

 Near and far UV Surface Brightness is calculated for 1kpc radius regions around supernovae using data from [Galex] (http://galex.stsci.edu/GR6/). These values are found using the Python3 code [Surface Brightness.ipynb] (https://github.com/mwvgroup/Surface-Brightness/blob/master/Surface%20Brightness.ipynb). To use the code, first set the value of parameters located after the comment `#User set parameters`. These parameters include:

* `region_file` : The file path of a .reg file containing the names, locations, and redshifts for each supernova of interest.

* `output_file` : The file name of the output files.

* `fits_directory` : A directory containing the .fits files used to calculate surface brightness. The script will automatically search through all sub directories. To change this behavior, alter the code following the comment `#We create a list of .fits files to perform photometry on`

* `uv_type` : Set this object equal to 'nuv' or 'fuv' to signify observations in the near or far UV. This allows the code to set the remainder of the necessary parameters automatically.
	
The code begins by walking through the directory specified by the parameters above and building a list of .fits files to be analyzed. Files will only be added to the list if the filename contains either 'nd-int' or 'fd-int' depending on if `uv_type` is set equal to nuv or fuv respectively. These keywords distinguish int type files containing observations in the near and far UV. For an outline of different file types and naming conventions, GALEX maintains a list [here] (http://galex.stsci.edu/gr6/?page=ddfaq). After compiling this list, the script uses a .reg file to build a dictionary of redshifts and coordinates for each supernova of interest. It uses these coordinates to check each of the .fits files for an observed supernova and performs photometry using the [photutils package] (http://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with a 1 kpc radius aperture. 

The int type .fits files used in this project contain a circular collection of pixels corresponding to the observing telescope's field of view ([here is an example image] (https://github.com/mwvgroup/Surface-Brightness/blob/master/ds9.jpg)). All pixels outside this field of view are assigned a value of 0. If the photometry process returns 0, there is no immediate way of knowing if the corresponding supernova (and by extension the photometry aperture) is within the field of view. For such cases the script will perform photometry on a secondary check file. By default, the check file used is a wt type .fits file where zero valued pixels only occur outside the field of view. If performing photometry on the check file yields a non-zero value, then the aperture is deemed to be within the telescope's field of view.

Using the photometry results, the corresponding flux, luminosity, and surface brightness values are calculated and written to a .csv file. For each supernova region, only the value with the smallest error in surface brightness is written to this file. The script will also create a .csv file listing int type files that are either missing wt type check files, or do not have a supernova in their field of view. The third file generated by the code is a logarithmic plot of the surface brightness values versus redshift. Comments are contained within the .ipynd file to provide a step by step outline on how the code works.

#### Calculating Surface brightness from Photometry values

Using the photometry value from a .fits file, the corresponding flux is given in (erg sec-1 cm-2 Ã…-1) by a conversion factor

    flux = flux_conv * photom 

This conversion factor is given on the [Galex website] (http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/galex/FAQ/counts_background.html) and is different for near and far UV (1.40 x 10-15 for FUV and 2.06 x 10-16 for NUV). The Luminosity is then given by the flux times the surface area. Using the WMAP9 cosmology,

    from astropy.cosmology import WMAP9 as cosmo
    
    ldist = cosmo.luminosity_distance(redshift).cgs.value
    lum = flux * 4 * np.pi * (ldist**2) 
    
To find surface brightness we then convert from units of kpc^2 to armin^2 and then from arcmin^2 to arcsec^2

    arcmin = cosmo.kpc_comoving_per_arcmin(redshift).value**2 
    sbrightness = lum * arcmin / 3600
