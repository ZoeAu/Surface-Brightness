# Calculating UV Surface Brightness of 1kpc Radius Regions around Supernova

####Code Overview / use:

 The near and far UV Surface Brightness is calculated for 1kpc radius regions around supernova using data from [Galex] (http://galex.stsci.edu/GR6/). These values are found using the Python3 code [Surface Brightness.ipynb] (https://github.com/mwvgroup/Surface-Brightness/blob/master/Surface%20Brightness.ipynb). To use the code, first set the value of parameters located after the comment `#User set parameters`. These parameters include:

* region_file: The file path of a .reg file containing the names, locations, and redshifts for each supernova of interest.

* output_file: The directory where any generated output files should be written to.

* fits_directory: A directory containing the .fits files you want to calculate surface brightness from. The script will automatically search through all sub directories. To change this behavior, alter the code following the comment `#We create a list of .fits files to perform photometry on`

* uv_type: Set this object equal to 'nuv' or 'fuv' to signify observations in the near or far UV. This allows the code to set the remainder of the necessary parameters automatically.
	
The code begins by walking through the directory specified by the parameters above and building a list of .fits files to be analyzed. The code looks for the keywords 'nd-int' or 'fd-int' depending on if `uv_type` is set equal to nuv or fuv. These keywords correspond to int type files observed in the near and far UV respectively. For an outline of different file types, GALEX maintains a list of file naming conventions [here] (http://galex.stsci.edu/gr6/?page=ddfaq). 

The int type .fits files used in this project contain a circular collection of pixels corresponding to the observing telescope's field of view ([here is an example image] (https://github.com/mwvgroup/Surface-Brightness/blob/master/ds9.jpg)). All pixels outside this field of view are assigned a value of 0. If the photometry process returns 0, there is no immediate way of knowing if the corresponding supernova (and by extension the photometry aperture) is within the field of view. For such cases the script will perform photometry on a secondary check file. By default, the check file used is a wt type .fits where zero valued pixels only occur outside the field of view. If the performing photometry on the check file yields a non-zero value, then the aperture is deamed to be within the telescope's field of view.

Using the photometry results, the corresponding flux, luminosity, and surface brightness values are calculated and written to a .csv file. For each supernova region, only the value with the smallest error is written to this file. The script will also create a .csv file listing int type files that are either missing wt type check files, or do not have a supernova in their field of view. The third file generated by the code is a logarithmic plot of the surface brightness values versus redshift. A step by step outline of how the code works is commented within the .ipynd file. Instructions on how to get the script running are listed below.

* Friedman data table.csv: A table listing supernova considered in [Friedman 2015] (http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0465).

* observed_target_info.reg: A region file containing a collection of supernova not considered in Friedman 2015, along with their redshift and location.

* output NUV/FUV.csv: A .csv file containing numerical results generated by the Surface Brightness.ipynb. The .fits files used to generate this file are not included in the repository.

* output NUV/FUV plot.pdf: A plot of the values from Output NUV/FUV.csv showing surface brightness verses the redshift on a logarithmic scale.

* Friedman NUV/FUV plot.pdf: A plot of the values from Output NUV/FUV.csv showing surface brightness verses the redshift on a logarithmic scale. This plot only shows supernova from Friedman 2015.

* output NUV/FUV log.csv: A list of int type files that are either missing wt type check files, or do not have a supernova in their field of view.
